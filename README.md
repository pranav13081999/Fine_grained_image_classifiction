# Fine-grained-Image-Classification
**Project Title:** Fine-Grain Image Classification with MobileNet Architecture

**Description:**
This project aims to implement fine-grain image classification using the MobileNet architecture, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for mobile and embedded devices. The model is trained on a dataset of fine-grained categories, enabling accurate classification of visually similar classes. The project includes preprocessing scripts, model training scripts, and evaluation notebooks.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of fine-grain image classification using MobileNet architecture.
- Preprocessing scripts for data augmentation and normalization.
- Training scripts with adjustable hyperparameters and learning rate schedules.
- Evaluation notebooks with visualizations of model performance metrics.

**Dataset:**
The project uses a fine-grained image dataset named `CUB-200-2011`

**Model Architecture:**
MobileNet architecture is chosen for its lightweight design, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. The model's depth-wise separable convolutions enable efficient feature extraction while minimizing computational complexity.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the preprocessing scripts to augment and normalize the dataset.
4. Train the MobileNet model using the provided training scripts, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.
5. Evaluate the trained model's performance using the evaluation notebooks.
6. Optionally, deploy the trained model for inference in mobile applications or web services.
